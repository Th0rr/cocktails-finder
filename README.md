# cocktails finder
 Small tool to help you choose which ingredients to buy in order to maximize the number of cocktails you can prepare with those ingredients only.

 There is a pre set list of cocktails (in french), but you can change them in order to fit your needs.

 The recipes are not full, this is intentional because the only ingredients to be selected are the one to be considered expensive/difficult to find, reffered as key_ingredients in the code (for example orange juice is definetly not one of those obviously, but is present in some cocktails).
